The Heart as a Pump | Parallel Arrangement of the Circulation | The Vessels: Arteries, Veins, Lymphatics Flow Equation (Q=P/R) | Poiseuille’s Law (vascular resistance) | | Continue Learning | . The Heart as a Pump . The heart is a pump which acts to circulate plasma around the body. Red blood cells are suspended in that plasma, so they also get circulated around the body thanks to the work done by the heart. The right side of the heart pumps blood to the pulmonary circulation (to the lungs), where blood can be oxygenated and CO2 can be released for expiration. That oxygenated blood returns to the left side of the heart, where it is then pumped out to the systemic circulation. In the systemic circulation, blood can deliver oxygen and nutrients, and take up metabolic waste products (such as CO2) from tissues. Eventually, the blood in the systemic circulation–now deoxygenated–returns to the right side of the heart, and gets pumped to the pulmonary cirulation, and the cycle continues. . Note that the heart even pumps blood to itself via the coronary arteries. Disturbances to the heart can cause loss of blood flow, and therefore oxygenation, to tissues like the heart (resulting in angina or myocardial infarction) and the brain (resulting in syncope or stroke). . Parallel Arrangement of the Circulation . Notice that the cardiovascular system is one big loop or circuit in which blood continually circulates. Elements in a circuit, like organs in the cardiovascular circuit, could be connected either in series (one after the other) or in parallel (the circulation splits to feed all of the organs and then meets back up to return to the heart). Why might a system organized in series be undesirable? Just as breaking one lightbulb in a group of lightbulbs arranged in series will break the entire circuit, you can imagine that if we cut the flow of blood to one organ in this hypothetical circuit, all the organs after it will recieve less blood, and blood will back up and pool in the previous organs. . Instead, the body’s organs are organized in a parallel fashion so that the flow of blood to any one organ can be increased or decreased without affecting the other organs too much. . The Vessels: Arteries, Veins, Lymphatics . Flow Equation (Q=P/R) . Poiseuille’s Law (vascular resistance) . Continue Learning . It’s hard to fully learn any one part of the cardiovascular system without some base knowledge about other parts of the system, because it is one big loop. To make it easier, reread this overview page before you continue onward. The next sections will cover many of these topics in more depth to enhance your understanding. .",
